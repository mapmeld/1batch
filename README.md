## 1batch concept

You upload photos and select one batch of up to 8 photos to publish your profile.

You cannot add new photos for a long time (6 months?) but can hide / remove photos if you need to.

## Tech Stack

1batch is made with the Koa v2 framework, Mongo, Passport, and Cloudinary. I'm working to document every file and line of code of 1batch <a href="https://github.com/mapmeld/1batch/wiki">in the wiki</a> as a long-form full-stack tutorial.  <a href="https://github.com/mapmeld/1batch/wiki">Get started</a>.

## Testing

eslint, flow, and mocha

you should catch everything with ```npm test```
